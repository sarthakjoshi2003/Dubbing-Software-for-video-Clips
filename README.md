# Dubbing-Software-for-video-Clips
The repository consists of a project that used various AI/ML models and implemented them to develop a multilingual Dubbing Software with Synchronized lip to audio Vedios.
for running the project you just need to open the index fie in google Colab and execute the cells one by one.

We developed the AI model using various libraries and pretrained model which include:
Moviepy: for audio extraction from video.
Google Translate : For translating text from one language to another.
Google text to speech : for text to speech conversion
Wav2lip model: for lip to audio synchronization

# Applications:
# In edtech Industry OR YouTube for education:  
It can help the the Creators of the educational video to create video in one language and then dub this video into different language based upon the different students who understand in different language. With proper voice to lip sync and without any extra effort this can help the ed-tech teacher to get massive reach in different languages as well.

# Speech platform like TEDx:
It can help to dub speeches given in the TEDx platform so that it can reach to people with different linguistic background it can help the platform to reach to a crowd that do not understand a particular language without any human effort. 

# Podcasts: 
AI algorithms can analyze podcast content and listener preferences to provide personalized recommendations, helping audiences discover relevant episodes and improving overall listener engagement.
